# Syntax

Syntax is an in-development command-line utility to make writing CSS easier. Syntax is written in Python and is designed for speed and ease of use. Syntax is planned to have: variables, functions, nested elements, and uses an indented syntax similar to Python. Right now Syntax is not fully functional, and can not be used as a replacement for any other CSS pre-processors at the moment.
