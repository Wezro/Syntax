# Syntax

Syntax is an in-development command-line utility to make writing CSS easier. Syntax is written in Python and is designed for speed and ease of use. Syntax is planned to have: variables, functions, nested elements, and uses an indented syntax similar to Python. Currently it is not suggested to use Syntax as a replacement to the preprocessor you are using right now, as it is missing some key features such as functions and calculations, though feedback and testing is appreciated.
